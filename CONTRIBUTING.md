# Contributing

These skills are grounded in the [AI Evals For Engineers & PMs](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals) course. To contribute meaningfully, you should probably have taken it.

## How to contribute

Submit PRs directly. Be prepared to discuss your skill on GitHub -- we may have questions or suggestions.

See `AGENTS.md` for AI instructions on how skills are created in this repo.

## License

All contributions are published under the license in [LICENSE](LICENSE) (CC0 1.0 Universal).

## One rule

Do not submit copyrighted material from the course. Skills should be original work _informed by_ the course, not reproductions of it.
