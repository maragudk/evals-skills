# Evals Skills

## Creating skills

When creating a new skill, be concise but thorough.
Ground your output to the information in the textbook at docs/llm_eval_course_notes.pdf, from the [AI Evals For Engineers & PMs](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals) course.
If the file isn't there, ask your human to add it. It's not committed as part of the repo because it's copyrighted.

When creating a new skill in this repository:
- Always update the README.md to add the new skill to the "Available Skills" section
- Keep the list in alphabetical order
- Follow the format: `**skill-name** - Brief description of what the skill does`
- Keep the license the same by not adding a license to the skill at all, see LICENSE file
